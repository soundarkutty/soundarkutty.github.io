Why threat modelling Need ?

* Identify the threat in the early stage of SDLC it will reduce the cost and effort of fixing in the vulnerabilites software developer life cycle.
* Make sure we follow the compliance standard framework  e.g.OWASP ASVS, NIST, ISO 27001.
* Creates security mindset across the team.

Jow to perform and what are things need to collect before doing theat modelling.







**A threat model typically includes:**

* Description of the subject to be modeled

* Assumptions that can be checked or challenged in the future as the threat landscape changes

* Potential threats to the system

* Actions that can be taken to mitigate each threat

* A way of validating the model and threats, and verification of success of actions taken

**Top Threat Modelling Framework**

* STRIDE

* OWASP Top 10

* MITRE ATT&CK


**Let  take STRIDE threat modelling**

STRIDE is a threat modeling framework developed by Microsoft employees and published in 1999. The STRIDE threat model is focused on the potential impacts of different threats to a system:

* Spoofing

* Tampering

* Repudiation

* Information disclosure

* Denial of service

* Escalation of privileges
