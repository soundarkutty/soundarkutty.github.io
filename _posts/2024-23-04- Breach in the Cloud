Scenario

we have been alerted to a potential security incident. The Huge Logistics security team have provided you with AWS keys of an account that saw unusual activity, as well as AWS CloudTrail logs around the time of the activity. We need your expertise to confirm the breach by analyzing our CloudTrail logs, identifying the compromised AWS service and any data that was exfiltrated.
